# Simple script tool to get pid data from the satellite Astra 2

## Requirements
* A working minisatip server: you can get it at https://github.com/catalinii/minisatip.
* A satellite dish pointing to the position 28.2E.
* A Linux distribution.
* The ASTRA.xml file must be saved on the home directory or its subdirectories.

## How-to
Run the script in terminal and follow the instructions. The output will generate a root directory with the date of the scan as name in the Documents folder. Inside, you can find subdirectories for every frequency containing the raw pid data as ts MPEG stream file.

## Need your help !
I would like to improve the code and the formating because my skills in programming are very basic. The ASTRA.xml comes from the Transedit tool, you can provide an updated version if you like. I'm also interested to other satellite positions and would be happy to add your own xml file to my collection. Feel free to submit it.
